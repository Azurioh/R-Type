1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the R-Type protocol, which defines the
   commands and responses for managing rooms and player movements within
   a game environment using a binary protocol.

3.  R-Type Commands

   The following are the R-Type commands:
      - /!\ TO BE DEFINED

3.1.  Command Structure

   Each command is represented as a binary message with the following
   structure:

   1. Command Type: A 1-byte integer representing the command type.
   2. Data Length: A 4-byte integer representing the length of the data
      payload.
   3. Data Payload: The data specific to the command (if any).

   Command Types

   +---------+------------+
   | Command | Type Value |
   +---------+------------+
   |         |            |
   +---------+------------+

3.2.  Status Codes

   The following are the mandatory status codes included in the responses:

   - Preliminary reply
      - /!\ TO BE DEFINED

   - Positive reply
      - /!\ TO BE DEFINED

   - Negative reply
      - /!\ TO BE DEFINED

3.3.  Command Responses

   The following table outlines the expected responses for each command:

   +---------+---------------------+
   | Command | Possible Responses  |

3.3.1.  Data Structure

   The following are the data structures of the R-Type command
   responses:
      - /!\ TO BE DEFINED

3.3.2.  Success Responses
   - /!\ TO BE DEFINED

3.3.3.  Error Responses
   - /!\ TO BE DEFINED


4.  R-Type Events

   The following are the R-Type events (messages sent from the server
   to the client):

      - /!\ TO BE DEFINED

   Event Structure

   Each event is represented as a binary message with the following
   structure:

   1. Event Type: A 1-byte integer representing the event type.
   2. Data Length: A 2-byte integer representing the length of the data
      payload.
   3. Data Payload: The data specific to the event (if any).

   Event Types

   +-------------+------------+
   | Event       | Type Value |
   +-------------+------------+
   |             |            |
